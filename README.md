# Algorithms in C and JAVA.

## \[WIP]

## Programs in JAVA

1. BubbleSort

## Programs in C

1. SelectionSort(without shifting of positions but direct swapping)
2. ActualSelectionSort(with all the shifting instead of direct swapping)
3. BubbleSort

Note: This is a personal project. Hence, the programs in this repo may be very lacking.
But everyone is free to use the programs and understand them using the carefully written comments in the program code.

Every program here is written after understanding how they work and writing code from scratch.



To execute the C program, simply compile it using "**gcc Program.c**" or "**gcc Program.c -o Program\_executable**", then run the .exe file. Make sure you have **JDK** on your system.

If not, head over to: [**Instructions**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/download-and-install-jdk-on-windows-mac-and-linux/)

&nbsp;	example: 1) You have "**BubbleSort.c**" source code,

&nbsp;		 2) In terminal, head to same directory of the "**BubbleSort.c**" source code file.

&nbsp;		 3) **gcc BubbleSort.c** \[This will create "**a.exe**" file in Windows and "**a.out**" in linux in the same directory]

&nbsp;		 4) Run the .exe file by typing the command: **./a.exe** (or) **./a.out** in respective OS.

&nbsp;		 5) For a specific .exe file name: **gcc BubbleSort.c -o bubblesort1** \[This will create a "**bubblesort1.exe** file]

&nbsp;		 6) To run this program: **./bubblesort.exe**



To execute a Java Program, simple compile is using the "**javac Program.java**" command and execute it using "**java Program**" command. Make sure you have **gcc** on your system.

If not, head over to: [**Instructions**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c/setting-up-c-development-environment/)

&nbsp;	example: 1) You have "**BubbleSort.java**" source code.

&nbsp;		 2) In terminal, head to same directory of the "**BubbleSort.c**" source code file.

&nbsp;		 3) **javac BubbleSort.java** \[This will compile the code and convert it into Java byte code].

&nbsp;		 4) To run the program, **java BubbleSort** \[This will run Program].
